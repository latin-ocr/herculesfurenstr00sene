vi PREFACE.

unity of the tragedy, by introducing a
second plot, as it were. How simple and
efficient is the remedy of our poet! By
introducing, at the opening of the drama,
Juno giving vent to her anger at her ina-
bility to overeome Hercules by any means
of her own, and expressing her determi-
nation (see v. 84 and foll.) to conquer him
by himself, unity of aetion is restoredy
that part of the drama which represents
the madness of HerculeS‚ not only ceases
to be an awkward appendage‚ but becomes
the most interesting point to which the
reader‚ or spectator, prepared by the threat
of JunO, looks eagerly forward from the
beginning of the drama.
