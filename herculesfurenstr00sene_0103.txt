his thirst, to be surrounded by fruits eluding his grasp,
and to be placed beneath a rock threatening momenta·

rily to fall upon him.
756. Tityos; attempting to violate Latona; he was

for this crime fastened to the ground, while two vul-
tures consumed his entrails constantly growing again.

757. Danaides; the daughters of Danaus, for the
murder of their husbands, were condemned to fill a

perforated vessel.
758. Cadmeicles;”the daughters os Cadmus, Agave,

Autonoe, and Ino, who in their madness killed Agave's
son Pentheus.

759. Ter7·etque—-avis; the punishment of Phineus,
of being deprived of sight, and having his sood defiled
by the Harpyes, on account of his having revealed the
future to men, is well known. According to another
version of this myth, Phineus, at the instance of his
second wife Idaea, deprived his sons by his first mar-
riage of their sight, for which crime he afterwards suf-
fered the same punishment in the infernal regions,
which, according to the more familiar story, was in·
flicted upon him during his lisetime.

766. deformem—coercet; an adjustment of the toga
or pallium which the Romans call cinctus Gabinus,
when the two ends of the garment are tied together
in a knot which prevents a tasteful arrangement of
the folds, and causes deformem sinum.

767. ἰατεηῑ,· Bothe's emendation is highly probable.
He says Zurent is the stock from which luridus is de-
rived, just as lucidus, pallidus, validus, are derived
from luceo, palleo, valeo. The circumstance of the
word being a ἃπαξ λεγόμενον, ought not to be an objec-
tion to its reception into the text.
