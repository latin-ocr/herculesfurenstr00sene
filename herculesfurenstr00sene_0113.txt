METRES.

-—.—-

THE Hercules Furens of Seneca is, as regards the
metres, more simple than the Medea. Six kinds of
verses only are used in the former, while the latter
contains eleven3 but both plays resemble each other
as to the perfectiori and precision of their metrical exe-
cution. It will not be necessary to enter into a minute
description of these six metres, since the reader who
wishes for more complete information may be referred
to Munk's work on The Matres of the Greeks and Ro-

‘mans-‚³⁶

These six kinds of verses are:

1. The Iambicus trimeter acatalectus.

2. The Anapaesticus dimeter acatalectus.
The Anapaestieus monometer acatalectus.
. The Asclepiadeus trimeter catalectus.

. The Sapphicus minor.

. The Glyconicus.
