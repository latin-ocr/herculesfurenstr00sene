’ΤΟ PROFESSORS‚ TEA'CHERS, AND OTHERS
INTERESTED IN

CLASSICAL EDUCATION.

The Publishers of the Classical WVorks announced
in the annexed Catalogue, would ask the attention of
Professors, and those interested in Teaching, to the
following extract from the London Examiner, edited
by Mr. Taylor. In writing of the Boston editions
of the classics, by Felton‚ Wheeler, Woolsey, and
others, he says:

‘lt must be distinctly understood, that the object
of these several editions is to furnish students with
readable editions of the Greek ClassicS, editions that
shall form a happy medium between the text without
comment, which is so often unwisely put in the
hands of the learner, and those ponderous annota-
tions, which can only serve to perplex him. Hence,
the notes are explanatory and illustrative, rather than
critical, and their conciseness cannot be too much
praised. Their texts are those of the highest Euro-
pean scholar83 they are all fully, yet briefly illus-
trated by English notes3 and all are preceded by
such introductions as render them complete in them-
selveS, and furnish the student with that amount of
historica] and other information which enables him
to pursue his journey in a region not altogether
strange. All are exceedingly well printed in a good,
clear type, and are volumes as well fitted for the
library of a private gentleman, as for the school-mom
or the university.’

As the ¹most of these works are stereotyped, and conse-
quently do not get ‘out of print,' and are not ‘ out os
the marka? they can always be had, if applied sor di-
rectly to the publishers,
